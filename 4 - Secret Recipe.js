console.log("To make Katsu Curry, you'll need Panko, Dried Curry Mix, and your favorite cut of Meat.")
//I usually like having pork! There's other ingredients too btw, but you'll probably have them on hand.
console.log("To start, bread the cut of meat. You'll do this by first lathering the cut in an egg yolk and white mix.")
console.log("After this, you'll fry the breaded meat in oil.") //make sure to preheat it.
console.log("Meanwhile, you can make the curry sauce by following the instructions on the curry package of your choice.")
//usually, this just means dissolving it in water or chicken broth. 
console.log("After 10-12 minutes, take the meat out of the oil and put it on a plate.")
console.log("Finally, pour the curry on top of the meat, and you're done!")
//If you want to get fancy with it, you can also make some rice and steamed vegetables to go along with it.
